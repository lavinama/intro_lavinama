# Hi there 👋
I'm a masters's student at Imperial College London studying artificial intelligence.

- I'm currently working on trying to generate safety-critical scenarios using reinforcement learning techniques such as multi-Agent DDPG to test the control algorithms of autonomous vehicles. [Check it out.](https://github.com/lavinama/highway-env-tibi/tree/dev-highway-adv) 🚙 
- Interests: Robotics, Reinforcement Learning and Autonomous Vehicles
- Cool projects I've done 🗄:
    * Implemented from scratch the convolution, pooling, linear and batch norm layers in PyTorch. [Check it out.](https://github.com/lavinama/pytorch_blocks)
    * Designed a Residual Network to classify animals. [Check it out.](https://github.com/lavinama/cnn_NaturalImageNet) 🐘
    * Built from scratch a VAE and a GAN. [Check it out.](https://github.com/lavinama/generative_models) 🧞‍♂️
    * Built an ml model for predicting ships crew size. [Check it out.](https://github.com/lavinama/Cruise_ship_data_science) 🧞‍♂️

More cool projects coming up!
